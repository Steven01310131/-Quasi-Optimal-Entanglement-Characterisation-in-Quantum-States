Week 44: Initial Team Meeting and Repository Creation

- Held the initial team meeting to mark the beginning of the project.
- Created a GitHub repository to manage code development and version control.
- Joined a Slack channel to facilitate ongoing team communication and coordination.


Week 45: Learning about Bayesian Methods and Group Talk

- Spent time reading and learning about the Bayesian approach from the materials we got.
- Had a group meeting on Zoom to talk about the paper and how it relates to our work.
- Used our Slack channel to ask questions and talk more about the paper.


Week 46: Deep Engagement with the 2-Qubit Problem and Collaborative Meetings

- Began the week by receiving the 2-Qubit problem from Vahid, dedicating efforts to understanding its formulation and specifics.
- Examined the provided example code to guide our approach to solving the 2-Qubit problem.
- Initiated work on programming the 2-Qubit problem using the scikit-learn library.
- Conducted three in-person meetings at Angstrom to collaboratively discuss our progress, share insights, and strategize on the programming challenges.


Week 47: Addressing Technical Challenges and Integrating Sphere Point Distribution Code

- Conducted a team meeting to discuss the difficulties faced in progressing with the 2-Qubit problem.
- Identified specific technical challenges and reached out to our supervisor on Slack for expert guidance.
- Scheduled an online meeting with the supervisor for the 21st on Zoom to seek advice and clarification.
- Decided to integrate a new code component into our project. This code is designed to generate points evenly distributed across a sphere's surface, which is crucial for our work on the 2-Qubit problem.
- Student meeting at 24/11/ where discussed our progress this week and share insights and how to tackle some problems regarding how to sample from a sphere instead of cartesian coordinates for the bayssian optimization problem.

Week 48: Implementing and testing code using sampling from sphere

- Conducted a brief meeting between the students on Monday 27/11 where it was discussed how to implement the new code
- Meeting of Thursday 30/11 discusing how to do the presentation for the following week
- Throughout the week, our work was predominantly independent apart from Friday 1/11 where we had a meeting with the supervisors where we discussed our new implementation where it was discovered some of the results deviated from the required properties, specifically the need for normalization to 1.
- Started a Google Colab notebook to enhance the efficiency of sharing project results and progress with supervisors

Week 49: Working on the report and going through the code with the supervisors

- Conducted a quick meeting between the students on Monday 4/12 where we prepared for the upcoming presentation
- Meeting with one of the supervisors(Tuesday 5/12) where we discussed a bit of the mathematical backround and the next steps in the project which mostly included how to implement in code how to create a family of pure states(PSI).
- We worked the rest of the week mostly on the report to get a skeletal draft ready for feedback by the supervisors
- Another meeting on the Thursday 7/12 with the supervisors where we got some feedback on the current code and discussed the strategy and tools for the next part of the project

Week 50: Run final tests

- Finalized the code and run full scale test to reproduce the expected theoretical behaviour for the family of Psi
- Meeting 12/12 where we divided work regarding the poster and final parts that need to be added to the report
- Expectations for next week to have a first draft of the final report

Week 51: Finalasation of the report

- This week, our team primarily focused on individual tasks related to the report, and we successfully submitted the completed report to our supervisors on Wednesday.
- On Monday, December 18th, we held a brief meeting to discuss the poster.
