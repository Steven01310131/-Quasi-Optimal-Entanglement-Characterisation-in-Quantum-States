Week 44: Initial Team Meeting and Repository Creation

- Held the initial team meeting to mark the beginning of the project.
- Created a GitHub repository to manage code development and version control.
- Joined a Slack channel to facilitate ongoing team communication and coordination.


Week 45: Learning about Bayesian Methods and Group Talk

- Spent time reading and learning about the Bayesian approach from the materials we got.
- Had a group meeting on Zoom to talk about the paper and how it relates to our work.
- Used our Slack channel to ask questions and talk more about the paper.


Week 46: Deep Engagement with the 2-Qubit Problem and Collaborative Meetings

- Began the week by receiving the 2-Qubit problem from Vahid, dedicating efforts to understanding its formulation and specifics.
- Examined the provided example code to guide our approach to solving the 2-Qubit problem.
- Initiated work on programming the 2-Qubit problem using the scikit-learn library.
- Conducted three in-person meetings at Angstrom to collaboratively discuss our progress, share insights, and strategize on the programming challenges.


Week 47: Addressing Technical Challenges and Integrating Sphere Point Distribution Code

- Conducted a team meeting to discuss the difficulties faced in progressing with the 2-Qubit problem.
- Identified specific technical challenges and reached out to our supervisor on Slack for expert guidance.
- Scheduled an online meeting with the supervisor for the 21st on Zoom to seek advice and clarification.
- Decided to integrate a new code component into our project. This code is designed to generate points evenly distributed across a sphere's surface, which is crucial for our work on the 2-Qubit problem.
- Student meeting at 24/11/ where discussed our progress this week and share insights and how to tackle some problems regarding how to sample from a sphere instead of cartesian coordinates for the bayssian optimization problem.

Week 48: Implementing and testing code using sampling from sphere

- Conducted a brif meeting between the students on Monday 27/11 where it was discussed how to implement the new code
- Meeting of Thursday 30/11 discusing how to do the presentation for the following week
- During the week we worked mostly independently apart from Friday 1/11 where we had a meeting with the supervisors where wediscussed our new implementation where it was discovered some of the results didnt adhere to some properties that needed to be   followed (the results need to be normalized to 1)
- Started a Google Colab notebook to enhance the efficiency of sharing project results and progress with supervisors

Week 48: Working on the report and going through the code with the supervisors

- Conducted a quick meeting between the students on Monday 4/12 where we prepared for the upcoming presentation
- Meeting with one of the supervisors(Tuesday 5/12) where we discussed a bit of the mathematical backround and the next steps in the project
- We worked the rest of the week mostly on the report to get a skeletal draft ready for feedback by the supervisors
- Another meeting on the Thursday 7/12 with the supervisors where we got some feedback on the current code and discussed the strategy and tools for the next part of the project
